# building-energy

This Python web application allows mechanical engineers at the UC Davis Energy Conservation Office to analyze the energy performance of UC Davis buildings. It includes a simple user interface that allows users to easily select the building, energy type, model type, and dates to perform analyses and predict energy usage. Users will be able to easily generate numbers such as r2 scores and savings, as well as plots to compare data between specified dates. The simple interface of our application will also allow individuals such as other engineers and managers to analyze energy usage with little to no knowledge of how the specific code is written. Our application aims to increase usability and efficiency of analyzing energy usage in UC Davis buildings. 

# Setup
If you simply wish to run the Python code, just type
```python
mv_model 
```
to see the help output. There are two subcommands: simple and tmy. 

If you want to run the Node.js server or see more detail on the project, you should take a look at the [User Guide](https://docs.google.com/a/ucdavis.edu/document/d/1v8DetE_kWH1meEMuyJGWW_88s6TjK9tt1pT0Fw__7vg/edit?usp=sharing).
